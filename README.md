# :milky_way: ConvNet-Vis

ConvNet-Vis helps to visualize the Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with following methods.

- Activation of image from each layer
- Deconvolution
- Deep-Dream

## Requirements:
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* numpy
* scipy
* h5py
* wget
* six
* scikit-image

## Run:
Very first time it will download the weights of the model you pick, so it requires an internet connection. Also you can pass custom model.

```python
import vis

# For pretrained model visualization
convnet_vis = vis.ConvNet_Vis(image_path="cat.jpg")

# For custom model visualization
# model=<path-to-model> OR Keras Model obect
convnet_vis = vis.ConvNet_Vis(image_path="cat.jpg", model="final_model.hdf5")
```

> **NOTE:** Results will be stored in **vis** directory.

## For Tensorboard:

TensorBoard gives you flexibility to visualize all the test image on same model with brightness and contrast adustment.

```
tensorboard --logdir=<LOG-PATH (layerwise)>
```

## Todo:

- [ ] Deep-dream support for all the model. (Current Support only for InceptionV3)
